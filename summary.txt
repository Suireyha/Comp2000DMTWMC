We did the irat individually for 15mins
Then we did the trat together and went through each question, There were a few we had different like the git dif question which we collaborated on to come to the correct answer.
The teacher went through each question and we answered with what we got (we got them all right)
Finally we were give the task to create a GitHub repo and put several files in (of which this is one)
